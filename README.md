# Echo REST API

A basic REST API with a few interesting features so someone (myself included) can adapt this code in the future for any other project of their own.

## Features

* CRUD
* RESTful
* CORS enabled
* CSRF prevention
* Integration with PostgreSQL (can be changed to another DB supported by GORM)
* Pagination
* JWT restricted routes
* Very basic unit test case on `api/models`
* Rate limits
* Dockerized with multi-stage build
* Configuration optionally through environment variables
